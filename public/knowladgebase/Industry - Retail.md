# **How Shops Send You "Welcome Back\!" Messages**

### **Introduction: The Magic Message**

Have you ever walked into your favorite store and, a few moments later, received a special discount on your phone? How does your phone know you're there? It might seem like magic, but it's actually a clever piece of technology based on a simple action: the **digital handshake**.

When you connect to the store's free WiFi, it's like a friendly digital handshake that lets the store's systems know you've arrived. This document will explain, in a simple and step-by-step way, exactly how this digital magic works.

### **1\. The First Handshake: Connecting to the WiFi**

The single most important step in this entire process is you, the customer, connecting to the store's guest WiFi network. This action is the key that unlocks everything that follows.

This connection provides what is known as **Physical Presence Verification**. In simple terms, your WiFi connection is the definitive proof that tells the store's digital systems you are physically inside the building *right now*.

"Think of connecting to the WiFi as a **digital handshake**. You are reaching out to the store's network, and in return, the network recognizes you and confirms, 'Yep, this person is officially here\!'"

This handshake is the trigger for a pair of powerful systems working together behind the scenes to deliver a message directly to you.

### **2\. The Two Systems Behind the Curtain**

Two key technologies work together as a team to make this happen. Think of them as the 'Greeter' and the 'Messenger'.

* **The 'Greeter' (Flow Networks):** This system's main job is to manage the WiFi network. When you connect, it's the 'Greeter' that performs the digital handshake and verifies your physical presence. It is the intelligent system that knows you are in the store and signals to other platforms that you've arrived.  
* **The 'Messenger' (Everlytic):** This is the store's powerful communication platform. Its main job is to send out all kinds of messages, including promotions and special offers via SMS and WhatsApp.

Now that you've met the team, let's see how they work together to send you that timely offer.

### **3\. The Digital Handshake in Action: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Here is a complete walkthrough of the process, showing exactly how the 'Greeter' and the 'Messenger' cooperate to deliver a personalized message to your phone.

1. **Step 1: You Connect.** You walk into the shop and log into the free guest WiFi. This simple action is the starting point for the entire automated process.  
2. **Step 2: The 'Greeter' Takes Note.** The Flow Networks system, which manages the WiFi, instantly recognizes your connection. This is the trigger. It confirms you are physically on-site and prepares to send a signal.  
3. **Step 3: A Signal is Sent.** The Flow Networks system sends an automated, secure signal to the Everlytic system. This signal essentially says, "This specific customer just walked into the store."  
4. **Step 4: The 'Messenger' Delivers the Offer.** The Everlytic system receives the signal and, following its pre-programmed rules, automatically sends a personalized message to your phone. For example, you might receive an SMS that reads, "Hi Sarah, we see you're near the shoe department. Show this SMS for 15% off your purchase today\!"

### **4\. Why Do Shops Do This?**

This technology isn't just a gimmick; it's designed to create a better and more relevant shopping experience. It's a win-win that connects the physical store with the digital world, turning your real-world visit into a smarter, more responsive experience.

### **5\. Conclusion: A Smarter Shopping Trip**

The next time you receive a "welcome" message in a store, you'll know exactly how it works. That simple **digital handshake** of connecting to the WiFi kicks off an intelligent, automated process. The store's "Greeter" system confirms you're there and tells the "Messenger" system to send you a relevant offer.

# Flow Networks Website Project: The Ultimate AI Gateway Website

This workspace is dedicated to building **"THE BEST WEBSITE EVER"** for Flow Networks, a digital flagship that perfectly embodies our 'AI Gateway Vision' while meticulously supporting our current business strengths.

The WiFi acts as the authenticated gateway to hyper-local, context-aware AI experiences, with flexible backend hosting.
*   **Primary Identity (Current Business Focus):** Flow Networks is the premier provider of intelligent WiFi and digital engagement solutions, leveraging global leadership (Purple.ai) and our own innovation.

    *   **AVOID explicitly marketing "AI Agents" or "WiFi-Gated AI" as currently available, fully deployed products.**
*   **Phase 2 (Subtle Hinting - Future AI Gateway Vision):**
    *   The 'AI Gateway Vision' should be introduced as a forward-looking capability, a testament to our innovation, and the future potential of our solutions.
    *   Use phrases like "future-ready intelligence," "next-gen venue insights," "unlocking deeper potential," "AI-powered evolution," or "innovation roadmap" in dedicated, smaller sections, call-outs, or a future-focused blog/insights section.

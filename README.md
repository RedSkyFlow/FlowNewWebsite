-   **The full Flow Networks product suite and our "AI Gateway Vision."**
-   **The definitive sitemap and information architecture** (from `src/lib/constants.ts`).

## 🟦 3. STRICT INSTRUCTIONS — DO NOT DEVIATE

### ⛔ DO NOT:
-   **Invent new visual effects or UI components.** Use only what is defined in `WebsiteComponentsAndEffectsGuide.md`.
-   **Create page structures that deviate from the sitemap** in `src/lib/constants.ts`.
-   **Use hard-coded hex color values.** Use the semantic CSS variables from `globals.css` (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-accent`).
-   **Use generic marketing fluff.** Your copy must be strategic, benefit-driven, and reflect an expert tone.

### ✅ ALWAYS:
-   **Build with the approved components:** Your primary building blocks are `AnimatedHeading`, `EnhancedButton`, `GlassCard`, `perspex-card`, `AnimatedBorder`, `ScrollAnimatedSection`, `LogoShimmer`, and the `shadcn/ui` base components. Refer to `WebsiteComponentsAndEffectsGuide.md` for their usage.
-   **Follow the sitemap in `constants.ts` as the single source of truth** for all navigation and page structure.
-   **Implement the correct color hierarchy:** `--primary` is Teal (Foundation), `--secondary` is Blue (Action), `--accent` is Yellow (Highlight).
-   **Write SEO-optimized and AI-search-friendly content** by applying the principles from the SEO guide (clear headings, direct answers, semantic structure).
-   **Ensure all code is clean, modern, and performant,** using Next.js 15+ App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS best practices.

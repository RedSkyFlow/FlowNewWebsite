### **Home Page Content - Section 3: Why Choose Us / Key Benefits**

**Overall Goal of Section:** To clearly articulate the core advantages of partnering with Flow Networks. This section should build trust and demonstrate value by focusing on tangible outcomes and strategic differentiators, moving beyond simple features.

**Vibe Coding Angle:** This section will use a different visual layout from the "Core Offerings" to create visual interest and rhythm on the page. Instead of individual cards, we will use a more integrated, illustrative approach, combining icons, headlines, and text in a cohesive, multi-column layout. Each benefit will be wrapped in our `ScrollAnimatedSection` for a smooth, staggered entrance.

**I. Section Wrapper & Background Styling**

*   **Purpose:** To create a visually distinct section that continues the dark, premium theme.
*   **Visuals:** We will use the `bg-[#0A0903]` (Background Dark Primary) to return to the deepest dark, creating a strong contrast with the slightly lighter background of the "Core Offerings" section above it.
*   **Styling Directives (for a new `WhyChooseUsSection.tsx` component):**
    *   Apply consistent vertical padding (e.g., `py-20 md:py-28`).
    *   The background should be `#0A0903`.
    *   The entire section will be wrapped in `<ScrollAnimatedSection>`.

**II. Content Elements (within the section's container)**

1.  **Section Header (Title & Subtitle):**
    *   **Placement:** Centered, at the top of the section.
    *   **Title Element:** Use the `AnimatedHeading` component.
        *   **Code:** `<AnimatedHeading text="The Flow Networks Advantage" as="h2" className="text-h2 text-glow" wordAnimation={true} />`
        *   *Justification:* "Advantage" is a strong, benefit-oriented word that positions Flow Networks as a superior choice.
        *   **Title Styling:** Apply `text-h2` and `text-glow` (with `--glow-primary` - Teal) styles.
    *   **Subtitle Element:** `<p>`
    *   **Subtitle Copy:** "We combine cutting-edge technology with deep industry expertise to deliver solutions that are not just intelligent, but transformative. Hereâ€™s why industry leaders choose us."
        *   *Justification:* Reinforces our expertise and focus on transformation, providing a strong lead-in to the specific benefits.
    *   **Subtitle Styling:** Apply `text-lg text-secondary` (`rgba(226, 253, 255, 0.7)`) styles.

2.  **Benefits Grid:**
    *   **Element:** A `<div>` with a responsive grid layout.
    *   **Grid Structure:** A 4-column grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, and 1-column on mobile.
        *   `className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8 mt-16"`
    *   **Content:** The grid will contain four "Benefit Blocks," each highlighting a key advantage.

3.  **Benefit Blocks (Individual Benefits):**
    *   **Purpose:** To clearly and concisely communicate a core benefit.
    *   **Styling:** These will not be traditional cards. Instead, they will be styled content blocks with a large icon, a title, and a description. They will have a subtle hover effect (e.g., the icon scales and glows).
    *   **Animation:** Each block will be wrapped in a `<ScrollAnimatedSection>` with a staggered `delay` (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4).

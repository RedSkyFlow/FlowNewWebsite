### **Home Page Content - Section 1: Hero Section**

**Overall Goal of Section:** Immediately capture attention, communicate Flow Networks' core value proposition (current focus), establish a premium brand feel aligned with the Fundly aesthetic, and drive initial user engagement towards solutions.

**I. Section Wrapper & Background Styling (Conceptual Code - for `src/app/page.tsx` HeroSection component)**

*   **Purpose:** To establish the deep, dark, layered background and overall aesthetic of the hero section, consistent with the Fundly inspiration.
*   **Visuals:** `bg-[#0A0903]` (Background Dark Primary) with a subtle gradient overlay. Includes placeholders for dynamic background effects (particles, mouse glow).
*   **CSS/Tailwind Directives (to be applied within your `HeroSection` component):**
    ```css
    /* Existing HeroSection wrapper */
    .hero-section {
      @apply relative min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-center items-center text-center overflow-hidden;
      background-color: #0A0903; /* Background Dark Primary */
    }
    /* Add gradient overlay */
    .hero-section::before {
      content: '';
      @apply absolute inset-0;
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(0, 122, 128, 0.2) 0%, rgba(10, 9, 3, 0.5) 50%, rgba(106, 13, 173, 0.2) 100%); /* Flow Primary Teal / Background Dark Primary / Flow Digital Purple */
      z-index: 1; /* Below content */
    }
    .hero-section > div.container {
      @apply relative z-10; /* Ensure content is above overlay */
    }
    ```
*   **Dynamic Background Elements:**
    *   **Particle Background:** Integrate the `ParticleBackground` component (from `src/components/effects/ParticleBackground.tsx`) into this section.
    *   **Mouse Follower Glow:** Integrate the mouse follower glow effect (from `src/components/effects/MouseFollowerGlow.tsx` - *this component will need to be generated by Gemini later, based on our previous discussions about it*).

**II. Hero Content Elements (within the `HeroSection` container)**

1.  **3D Logo:**
    *   **Element:** `Image` component (Next.js optimized image)
    *   **File:** `FlowAINew3DLogo_on_DarkPrimary.png` (or `_on_Teal.png` if it looks better with the specific gradient, but `_on_DarkPrimary.png` is generally more versatile for dark backgrounds).
    *   **Placement:** Centered above the main title.
    *   **Styling:** Apply `logo-3d` class (from blueprint) for dimensions, 3D effect, glow, and hover.
    *   **Alt text:** "Flow Networks 3D Logo - Intelligent Venue Solutions"
    *   **Purpose:** Immediate brand recognition, establish premium, high-tech identity.

2.  **Main Title (H1):**
    *   **Element:** `<h1>`
    *   **Copy:** "Transform Your Venue. Grow Your Brand. With Intelligent Connectivity."
        *   *Justification:* Directly addresses the core value proposition for clients (transformation, growth) using the key current product concept "Intelligent Connectivity," which encompasses WiFi and data. It's concise, impactful, and client-benefit focused.
    *   **Styling:** Apply `text-hero`, `text-gradient-animated`, and `text-glow` classes (from blueprint) for dynamic visual effect and premium feel.
    *   **SEO/AI Search Optimization:** Contains primary keywords for Flow Networks' current offerings (`Intelligent Connectivity`, `Venue Transformation`).

3.  **Subtitle/Tagline (P):**
    *   **Element:** `<p>`
    *   **Copy:** "Seamlessly connecting people in physical spaces. Harnessing real-time data for unparalleled engagement and operational excellence."
        *   *Justification:* Expands on the core message, highlighting key mechanisms (connectivity, data) and benefits (engagement, operational excellence) that Flow Networks' current solutions deliver.
    *   **Styling:** Apply `text-lg text-secondary` classes (from blueprint).
    *   **SEO/AI Search Optimization:** Incorporates supporting keywords (`physical spaces`, `real-time data`, `engagement`, `operational excellence`).

4.  **Description (Optional - for more detail, can be added below subtitle):**
    *   **Element:** `<p>`
    *   **Copy:** "Flow Networks provides cutting-edge solutions that bridge the physical and digital realms, empowering organizations to drive meaningful improvements and deliver curated experiences tailored to every visitor."
        *   *Justification:* Reinforces the "bridging" concept and highlights the tailored, curated experience that is a hallmark of your solutions.
    *   **Styling:** Apply `text-base text-muted` classes (from blueprint).

5.  **Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons:**
    *   **Button 1 (Primary):**
        *   **Text:** "Explore Our Solutions"
        *   **Link:** `/solutions`
        *   **Styling:** Apply `btn-primary` class (from blueprint, using `Flow Action Blue`). Ensure it has hover effects (glow, lift) as per blueprint.
        *   **Purpose:** Drive users deeper into the product offerings section of the website.
    *   **Button 2 (Secondary):**
        *   **Text:** "Request a Demo"
        *   **Link:** `/contact`
        *   **Styling:** Apply `btn-tertiary` class (from blueprint, transparent with `Flow Primary Teal` border/text). Ensure it has hover effects.
        *   **Purpose:** Direct lead generation.

**III. Image/Video Content Description for Generator (for Hero Background - if needed):**

*   **Type:** Abstract digital render or subtle animation/video.
*   **Prompt Hint:** "Abstract digital network visualization with glowing nodes and data pathways, subtly moving across a deep dark blue/black background. Incorporate soft teal and blue light trails. No specific real-world objects, just an abstract representation of connectivity and intelligence."
*   **Purpose:** To visually reinforce the "connectivity" and "intelligence" theme in a dynamic, non-distracting way behind the main content.

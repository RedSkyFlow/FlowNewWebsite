## 🟦 3. STRICT INSTRUCTIONS — DO NOT DEVIATE

### ⛔ DO NOT:
- Invent new visual effects or UI components.
- Create page structures that deviate from the sitemap.
- Use fonts, tones, or colors not included in the brand guide.
- Oversimplify complex B2B concepts — speak to informed professionals.
- Use casual or generic marketing fluff.

### ✅ ALWAYS:
- **Use approved page components, layouts, effects**, and **naming conventions** from the design system.
- Use the **“What, How, Why” narrative model** as your primary information hierarchy.
- Refer directly to product names and platform integrations as outlined (e.g., Purple, Allxs, CNNTAP, Everlytic).
- Ensure **every section is findable, scannable, and discoverable** via search and navigation.
- Match **tone** to brand guide: *Confident, expert, grounded in real-world impact*.
- Prioritize **high-context, high-relevance messaging** over surface-level appeal.

## 🟥 4. WHEN IN DOUBT — REFER TO THESE FILES:

If at any point you are unclear, missing details, or unsure of content depth, **consult the knowledgebase and reference files uploaded to the `docs` directory**. They are your **source of truth**.

### 🔍 Here are the folders you must reference when needed:
- `code-examples/Extra Content and Deep research`  
  → Deep competitive analysis, product breakdowns, strategic analysis.

- `Product_Knowledgebase/`  
  → Flow product content integration guides.

- `Website Design Knowledgebases/`  
  → SEO strategies, component documentation, effect usage.

- `page-content-files/`  
  → Page-specific copywork in progress.

### ⚠️ Critical rule: If you encounter ambiguity, **never guess.**  
Instead, reply with:  
> “Refer to `docs/[filename]` for clarification”  
> or  
> “Awaiting confirmation — recommend checking: [related file name]”.

## 🟪 5. YOUR PRIMARY STRUCTURE

The website must strictly follow the **approved sitemap** and structure defined in the project brief:

- `/` — **Home** → Introduces the problem & Flow’s unified value proposition.
- `/products` → Shows standalone product strength.
- `/solutions` → Maps tech to real-world business challenges.
- `/industries` → Speaks the language of each vertical.
- `/resources` → Guides, tools, and proof points.
- `/company` → Brand, partners, compliance, careers.
- `/contact` → Conversion and support hub.

Every page must clearly identify:
1. **What the visitor needs to know**
2. **Why it matters**
3. **What to do next**

## 🟫 6. DESIGN & COPY GUIDELINES

### ✅ Visual Effects & Classes You Must Use:
Use only these visual classes (as defined in `globals.css`) and components:

- `#0282F2` (CTA Blue)

## 🟨 7. WRITING & STRUCTURE RULES

- **Write with clarity, precision, and impact.**
- **Use benefit-first framing**: "What this does → Why it matters → What it enables"
- **Use modular subheadings** with value propositions.
- Each section must earn attention and guide the user to the next logical step.

This is the power of integrated venue intelligence."

*   **Use Case - Airports:** "A frequent flyer with the airline's app (using SecurePass) enters the airport. Their phone auto-connects to the WiFi. The Flow AI Gateway recognizes them and triggers a push notification via Everlytic: 'Welcome back, Adam. Your flight is on time at Gate B12. Enjoy complimentary lounge access, courtesy of your loyalty status.'"
*   **Use Case - Shopping Malls:** "A shopper who has previously opted-in connects to the mall's WiFi. Based on their location analytics (dwell time near a specific store), Flow's AI Gateway triggers an SMS via Everlytic: 'Hi Sarah, we see you're near [Store Name]. Show this SMS for 15% off your purchase today!'"

**Directive 4: Emphasize the Power of Combined Data.**
*   **Instruction:** Explain that by combining Flow Networks' presence and behavior data (who, when, where) with Everlytic's communication platform (what, how), businesses can create a truly unified and responsive customer journey that bridges the physical and digital divide.


## 1. Vision & Core Objective

**Flow's AI Gateway - "Flow Connect"** is an intelligent, conversational AI assistant designed to transform the standard guest WiFi authentication process from a generic, impersonal task into a seamless, personalized, and value-added digital interaction.

The primary objective is to get users connected to WiFi as efficiently as possible while simultaneously creating opportunities for guest engagement, data collection, and brand reinforcement, all driven by a friendly and helpful AI persona named 'Flow Connect'.

## 2. Key Features & Achievements

This system moves beyond simple web forms by integrating a sophisticated AI-driven workflow. Here's what it achieves:

*   **Conversational AI Interface:** Users interact with Flow Connect, a digital host, through a familiar chat interface, making the process more intuitive and less intimidating than traditional captive portals.
*   **Dynamic, AI-Driven Authentication Flow:** The backend AI (`determine-next-step` flow) acts as a state machine, dynamically deciding the next logical step based on user input, session data, and venue configuration. This allows for complex, branching logic without hard-coded UI flows.
*   **Venue-Specific Configuration:** The entire experience—from welcome messages and branding to available authentication methods and marketing offers—is loaded dynamically from a Firestore database. This allows the same application to be deployed across multiple venues (e.g., hotels, cafes, airports) with unique configurations.
*   **Multi-Modal Authentication Support:** The system is built to guide users through various authentication paths, including:
    *   Property Management System (PMS) integration (simulated via room number/last name).
    *   Social Logins (Google, Facebook).
    *   Future methods like email/SMS OTP.
*   **Progressive Conversational Profiling:** After authentication is complete, Flow Connect can engage the user with simple, context-aware questions (e.g., "Are you here for business or pleasure?"). This enriches the guest profile in a natural, non-intrusive way.
*   **Personalized User Experience:** The AI leverages collected data to tailor its responses. For example, wishing a business traveler a "productive stay" versus a leisure traveler a "pleasant stay."
*   **Integrated Marketing & Compliance:** The flow seamlessly incorporates mandatory steps like accepting Terms of Use and optional steps like opting into marketing offers.

## 3. Use Cases

*   **Primary Use Case (Hotels & Hospitality):** A hotel guest opens their laptop to connect to the "Grand Hotel WiFi." Instead of a standard login page, they are greeted by Flow Connect. Flow Connect guides them through connecting with their room number and last name, asks if they'd like to opt-in for a spa discount, and then asks if their stay is for business or leisure. The hotel gains a connected guest, a marketing lead, and a piece of valuable customer data.
*   **Secondary Use Case (Retail & Cafes):** A customer at a coffee shop connects to the guest WiFi. Flow Connect welcomes them, offers a "deal of the day" marketing opt-in, and gets them online quickly using a social login, enhancing customer engagement.
*   **Tertiary Use Case (Events & Venues):** Attendees at a conference use Flow Connect to connect. The system can be configured to ask for their professional interests to provide a more tailored event experience.

## 4. How It Works (High-Level Architecture)

1.  **Client (Next.js/React):** The `ChatInterface.tsx` component serves as the main user-facing element. It manages the conversation history, user input, and the user's session state (`currentAiContext`).
2.  **Configuration (Firestore):** On load, the client fetches the specific configuration for the `venueId` from the `venues` collection in Firestore.
3.  **User Interaction:** The user sends a message.
4.  **AI Brain - Step 1 (`determine-next-step`):** The client sends the user's input, session state, and venue configuration to this Genkit flow. The AI's only job is to analyze the situation and return a single, definitive "next step" (e.g., `COLLECT_PMS_LAST_NAME`, `CONNECTION_SUCCESSFUL`).
5.  **AI Brain - Step 2 (`dynamic-conversational-responses`):** The client takes the "next step" from the previous flow and sends it, along with the original input and context, to this second Genkit flow. This flow's job is to craft Flow Connect's human-friendly verbal response based on the determined step.
6.  **Client Updates:** The client displays Flow Connect's response. If the new step requires a UI change (like showing authentication buttons or the success banner), the client's state updates to reflect that.
7.  **Data Persistence:** If a step involves collecting data (like a profiling answer), the client writes this information to the `users` collection in Firestore before proceeding.

This two-step AI process separates the **logical decision-making** from the **creative response generation**, making the system more robust and easier to debug.

## 5. Current Project State (As of our last interaction)

*   **Foundation:** The core architecture described above is fully implemented.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   The chat interface is functional.
    *   Venue configuration loading from Firestore is working.
    *   AI-driven flow for Terms of Use, PMS authentication, and Marketing Opt-in is in place.
    *   The **Progressive Conversational Profiling** feature has been implemented.
*   **Known Issue:** We have identified and are resolving a persistent "hang" or stall at the very end of the conversation. After the user answers the final profiling question, there is a significant delay, and the user sometimes needs to send another message (e.g., "hello") to trigger the final success response from Flow Connect. The personalization of the final message ("productive" vs. "pleasant" stay) is also not working as intended.

## 6. Next Steps

1.  **Resolve the Final Step Bug:** This is our **immediate priority**. We need to diagnose why the flow stalls after the user answers the profiling question.
    *   **Hypothesis 1 (AI Prompt):** The prompt for the `CONNECTION_SUCCESSFUL` step in `dynamic-conversational-responses.ts` might be confusing the AI, causing a long processing delay or failure.
    *   **Hypothesis 2 (Client-Side Logic):** There might be an issue in the `async/await` handling within the `processAiInteraction` function in `ChatInterface.tsx`.
    *   **Action:** Our next action is to refine the prompt for the `CONNECTION_SUCCESSFUL` step to be extremely explicit, which may solve both the hang and the personalization failure. If that doesn't work, we will need to add more detailed logging to the client-side logic to trace the execution flow.
2.  **Enhance Robustness:** Add more comprehensive error handling for failed AI calls or database operations.
3.  **Implement More Authentication Methods:** Build out the client-side logic for handling real social logins and potential email/SMS OTP flows.
4.  **Expand Profiling:** Increase the number and complexity of profiling questions, potentially branching the conversation based on answers.
